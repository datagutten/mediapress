Embed MediaWiki in a WordPress site and allow users to navigate the wiki without leaving your WordPress page.

##Description##

The project is inspired by RDP Wiki-Press Embed by Robert D Payne. Some code is also copied (indicated with code comments).

The difference is that this is simpler. It contains as little CSS as possible to be able to customize it for each theme.

Links are rewritten to make the users able to navigate in the wiki without leaving your WordPress page.

The text on the wiki image page will be added as a title="" tag to the image in WordPress, so by using the plugin [simple-lightbox](http://archetyped.com/tools/simple-lightbox), the text will be shown below the image in the lightbox.

It is developed for use with a private MediaWiki install, but it might work with Wikipedia as well.
